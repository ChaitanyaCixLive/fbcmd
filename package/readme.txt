Everything in the package directory is there for Dave to package up the code and put online.

It doesn't really need to be in the repository, but it's (mostly) harmless.

Probably the only useful thing is the msi\fbcmd.wxs file for making a windows install.

I had a hard time finding good examples of .wxs files to do what I wanted, so maybe this will help someone.

	<h2>FBCMD (R.I.P.)</h2>
	
	<p><b>April 30, 2015</b>
	<p>The <b>fbcmd</b> (Facebook Command Line Interface) project is no longer active. You can still find the lukewarm corpse of the project at the links below.
	<p>I stared this project in 2007, when both facebook and I were very different.
		
	<ul>
		<li>I am now raising a family and have a demanding job.  When I do get precious "free" time, there are other projects I'd 
        rather spend my time on.
		<li>I log in to facebook once a week and lurk around for a bit, but I rarely interact or share anything. I stopped using <b>fbcmd</b> 
        myself.<li>Facebook is moving away from apps that have broad access and permissions.  Bad apps have ruined it for everyone.
		<li>It was too frustrating to keep up with facebook perpetually depricating features and changing its API.<br>
			The straw(s) that broke the camel's back were: depricating API 1.0, removing <tt>offline_access</tt> and changing the authentication model.
	</ul>
	
	<p>I want to thank the hundreds of people who contributed or sent kind words my way.
	
	<p>I have over 300 email messages in a "fbcmd-todo" folder that I will probably never "do". My sincerest apologies.

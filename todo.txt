OLD pre 2.0 FEATURE REQUESTS
============================
* [From Carl C.] More comprehensive Backup options

* [from Jeremy M.] Upload Photos to a Group

* Allow user to "alias" their key friends for easier reference
* Option to Cache your Friend info, etc. to make faster FLISTS
* Enhance TAGPIC: Add a 'latest' and use same format as @tagging in status
* Facebook just updated the EVENT API... look into adding commands such as RSVP
* Should add a 2nd STREAM parameter for when to start from ... ie: STREAM #family 100 200 would give posts 100->200
* add a FINDPOST command that searches the contents of posts. I'm waiting to see how the API will open this up
* Some kind of interface to display who you are and aren't following
* Perhaps a PINFO Command similar to FINFO
* The Facbeook Group Interface is lame... but maybe GINFO, GINFO, GEVENTS?
* Add attachments to MSGs
* Possibly a =family FLIST parameter?
* Make it so you can reference albums by Name instead of ID
